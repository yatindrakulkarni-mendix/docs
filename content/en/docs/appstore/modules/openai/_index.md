## 1 Introduction {#introduction}

The [OpenAI Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/220472) allows you to integrate generative AI into your Mendix app and is compatible with [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/) as well as [Azure's OpenAI service](https://oai.azure.com/). 

The current scope covers text generation use cases based on the [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat), image generation use cases based on the [Image Generations API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images), and embeddings use cases based on the [Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings).

Image generations with the DALL-E models is currently supported only by OpenAI, while Azure OpenAI only supports it in preview mode. For all other operations, Mendix provides dual platform support for OpenAI as well as Azure OpenAI.

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases {#use-cases}

#### 1.1.1 Text Generation {#use-cases-text}

* Develop interactive AI chatbots and virtual assistants that can carry out conversations in a natural and engaging manner. 
* Use OpenAI’s large language models for text comprehension and analysis use cases such as summarization, synthesis, and answering questions about large amounts of text.
* Fine-tune the OpenAI models on a specific task or domain, by training it on custom data, to improve its performance. 
* Integrate more easily with OpenAI’s platform which, by providing text generation models, allows you to build applications with the following features:
    * Draft documents 
    * Write computer code 
    * Answer questions about a knowledge base 
    * Analyze texts 
    * Give software a natural language interface 
    * Tutor in a range of subjects 
    * Translate languages 
    * Simulate characters for games 

OpenAI provides market-leading large language model capabilities with GPT-4: 

* Advanced reasoning: Follow complex instructions in natural language and solve difficult problems with accuracy. 
* Creativity: Generate, edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user’s writing style. 
* Longer context: GPT-4 is capable of handling over 25,000 words of text, allowing for use cases like long form content creation, extended conversations, and document search and analysis. 

#### 1.1.2 Image Generation {#use-cases-images}

Generate one or more completely new, original images and art from a text description. Powered by the OpenAI DALL-E models, the connector enables developers to generate these images by combining concepts, attributes, and styles.

#### 1.1.3 Embeddings {#use-cases-embeddings}

Convert strings into vector embeddings for various purposes based on the relatedness of texts. 
Embeddings are commonly used for:

* Search 
* Clustering 
* Recommendations 
* Anomaly detection 
* Diversity measurement 
* Classification 

Combine embeddings with text generation capabilities and leverage specific sources of information to create a smart chat functionality tailored to your own knowledge base.

#### 3.1.2 Azure OpenAI Configuration {#azure-openai-configuration} 

The following inputs are required for the Azure OpenAI configuration: 

| Parameter      | Value                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DisplayName    | This is the name identifier of a configuration, e.g. *MyConfiguration*. |
| API type       | Select `AzureOpenAI`.<br />For more information, see the [ENUM_ApiType](#enum-apitype) section. |
| Endpoint       | This is the API Endpoint, e.g. `https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/`.<br />For more information about how to obtain `your-resource-name`, see the [Obtaining Azure OpenAI Resource Name](#azure-resource-name) section below. |
| DeploymentName | This is the deployment name you chose when you deployed the model. Deployments provide endpoints to the Azure OpenAI base models, or your fine-tuned models.<br />To check the deployment name, go to [Azure OpenAI](https://oai.azure.com/) and check the deployment name under **Deployments**. |
| API version    | This is the API version to use for this operation. This follows the `yyyy-MM-dd` format. See [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference) for supported versions. |

| Key type       | This is the type of token that is entered in the API key field. For Azure OpenAI, two types of keys are currently supported: `Microsoft Entra token` and `API key`. <br />For more information about how to generate a Microsoft Entra access token, see [How to Configure Azure OpenAI Service with Managed Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity). Alternatively, if your organization allows it, you could use the Azure **api-key** authentication mechanism. For more information about how to obtain an `API key`, see the [Obtaining Azure OpenAI API keys](#azure-api-keys) section below. For more information, see the [ENUM_KeyType](#enum-keytype) section. |

{{% alert color="info" %}}
For the Azure OpenAI configuration, each model needs a separate deployment so that it can be used. In order to benefit from multiple supported operations in your Mendix app, you need to create multiple configuration objects, one for every deployed model. For details, see the [Azure OpenAI Service REST API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/ai-services/openai/reference).

##### 3.1.2.1 Obtaining Azure OpenAI Resource Name {#azure-resource-name}

1. Go to the [Azure OpenAI portal](https://oai.azure.com/) and sign in.
2. On the upper-right corner, click **Settings** ({{% icon name="cog" %}}). 
3. Go to the **Resource** tab.
4. Go to **Current resource** and click **JSON view**.
5. Use the value of the **name** field as your resource name in the endpoint URL.

##### 3.1.2.2 Obtaining Azure OpenAI API keys {#azure-api-keys}

1. Go to the [Azure OpenAI portal](https://oai.azure.com/) and sign in.
2. On the upper-right corner, click **Settings** ({{% icon name="cog" %}}). 
3. Go to the **Resource** tab.
4. Go to **Current resource** and click **JSON view**.
5. Use the value of the **key1** or **key2** field as your API key while setting up the configuration. Note that these keys might not be available depending on your organization's security settings. 

### 3.2 Chat Completions Configuration {#chat-completions-configuration} 

After following the general setup above, you are all set to use the microflows in the **USE_ME > Operations > ChatCompletions** folder in your logic. Currently, three microflows for chat completions are exposed as microflow actions under the **OpenAI Connector** category in the **Toolbox** in Mendix Studio Pro. 

These microflows expect a [Configuration](#configuration-entity) entity, as well as the desired AI model that should be used for generating responses. 

* For the OpenAI API configuration, the desired model must be specified for every call.
* For the Azure OpenAI configuration, the model is already determined by the deployment in the [Azure OpenAI portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal). Any model explicitly specified will be ignored and hence can be left empty. 

In the context of chat completions, system prompts and user prompts are two key components that help guide the language model in generating relevant and contextually appropriate responses. For more information on prompt engineering, see the [Read More](#read-more) section. It varies per exposed microflow activity which prompts are required and how these must be passed, as described in the following sections. For more information, see the [ENUM_Role](#enum-role) section.

For more inspiration or guidance on how to use the above-mentioned microflows in your logic, Mendix highly recommends downloading our [showcase app](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/220475) from the Marketplace that displays a variety of examples. 

#### 3.2.1 `Chat Completions (without history)` {#chatcompletions-without-history}

The microflow activity `Chat Completions (without history)` supports scenarios where there is no need to send a list of (historic) messages comprising the conversation so far as part of the request. The system prompt and user prompt are available as string input parameters. Depending on the use case, both or only one can be used. For technical details, see the [Technical reference](#chat-completions-without-history-technical) section.

Functionally, the prompt strings can be written in a specific way and can be tailored to get the desired result and behavior. For more information on prompt engineering, see the [Read More](#read-more) section.

#### 3.2.2 `Chat Completions (with history)` {#chatcompletions-with-withory}

The microflow activity `Chat completions with history` supports more complex use cases where a list of (historical) messages (e.g. comprising the conversation or context so far) is sent as part of the request to the language model. Two accompanying microflows are available to construct the input for the microflow:

* `ChatCompletionsSession_Create` is used to create the session wrapper that must be passed as input parameter. 
* `ChatCompletionsSession_AddMessage` is used to attach the historical messages to the `ChatCompletionsSession`. 

The content of such a message corresponds to a system, assistant, or user prompt. In the case of multiple historical messages the order is relevant.

For technical details, see the [Technical reference](#chat-completions-with-history-technical) section.

#### 3.2.3 `Chat Completions (advanced)` {#chatcompletions-advanced}

The microflow activity `Chat Completions (advanced)` can be used in cases where the above-mentioned microflows do not provide enough support or flexibility. The interface of this operation resembles the API interface. The construction of the request and handling of the response must be implemented in a custom way. Three accompanying microflows are available to construct the input for the microflow:

* `ChatCompletionsRequest_Create` is used to create the request object.
* `ChatCompletionsMessages_Create` is used to create the wrapper object for the `ChatCompletionsMessageRequest` objects.
* `ChatCompletionsMessageRequest_Create` is used to create the message objects.

The construction of the request and handling of the response must be implemented in a custom way.

For technical details, see the [Technical reference](#chat-completions-advanced-technical) section.

### 3.3 Image Generations Configuration {#image-generations-configuration}

In order to implement image generations into your Mendix application, you can use the microflows in the **USE_ME > Operations > ImageGenerations** folder. Currently, two microflows for image generations are exposed as microflow actions under the **OpenAI Connector** category in the **Toolbox** in Mendix Studio Pro. 

These microflows, similar to the [Chat Completions](#chat-completions-configuration) case, expect a [Configuration](#configuration-entity) entity, as well as the desired AI model that should be used for generating image responses in the case of OpenAI configurations. In this case the field is optional, as OpenAI assumes a default value `dall-e-2`.

For more inspiration or guidance on how to use the below-mentioned microflows in your logic, Mendix highly recommends downloading our [showcase app](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/220475) from the Marketplace that displays a variety of examples. 

#### 3.3.1 `Image Generations (single image)` {#imagegenerations-single}

The microflow activity `Image Generations (single image)` supports scenarios where a single image must be generated based on the provided prompt. In order to implement this operation, you must create a specialization of the [GeneratedImage](#generatedimage) entity. For every implementation of this microflow, an instance of this specialization has to be created first and must be passed into the `OutputImage` parameter of the microflow. If the call is successful, the image generated by the model will be stored into that object.
For technical details, see the [Technical reference](#image-generations-single-technical) section.

#### 3.3.2 `Image Generations (advanced)` {#imagegenerations-advanced}

The microflow activity `Image Generations (advanced)` can be used in cases where the above-mentioned microflows do not provide enough support or flexibility. The interface of this operation resembles the API interface. The construction of the request and handling of the response must be implemented in a custom way. One accompanying microflow is available to construct the input for the microflow:

* `ImageGenerationsRequest_Create` is used to create the request object.

The construction of the request and handling of the response must be implemented in a custom way.

For technical details, see the [Technical reference](#image-generations-advanced-technical) section.

### 3.4 Embeddings Configuration {#embeddings-configuration}

In order to implement embeddings into your Mendix application, you can use the microflows in the **USE_ME > Operations > Embeddings** folder. Currently, three microflows for embeddings are exposed as microflow actions under the **OpenAI Connector** category in the **Toolbox** in Mendix Studio Pro. 

These microflows expect a [Configuration](#configuration-entity) entity, as well as the desired AI model that should be used for generating responses. 

* For the OpenAI API configuration, the desired model must be specified for every call.
* For the Azure OpenAI configuration, the model is already determined by the deployment in the [Azure OpenAI portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal). Any model explicitly specified will be ignored and hence can be left empty. 

#### 3.4.1 `Embeddings (single input)` {#embeddings-single}

The microflow activity `Embeddings (single input)` supports scenarios where the vector embedding of a single string must be generated. This input string can be passed directly as the `Input` parameter of this microflow. Note that the parameter `EncodingFormat` is optional; the current version of this operation only supports the float representation of the resulting vector.

For technical details, see the [Technical reference](#embeddings-single-technical) section.

#### 3.4.2 `Embeddings (list input)` {#embeddings-list}

The microflow activity `Embeddings (list input)` supports the more complex scenario where a list of strings must be vectorized in a single API call, e.g. converting a batch of text strings (chunks) from a private knowledge base into embeddings. Instead of calling the API for each string, executing a single call for a list of strings can significantly reduce HTTP overhead. The embedding vectors returned after a successful API call will be stored as `EmbeddingVector` attribute in the same `DataChunk` entity. Thus, the microflow does not return an Object or List, but only a `Success` Boolean. Two accompanying microflows are available to help construct the input for the main microflow: 

* `DataBatch_Create` is used to create the wrapper object for the list of `DataChunk` objects that must be passed as input parameter. 
* `DataChunk_Create` can be used repetitively to attach a chunk of text (as a string) to the `DataBatch` entity. 

For technical details, see the [Technical reference](#embeddings-list-technical) section.

#### 3.4.3 `Embeddings (advanced)` {#embeddings-advanced}

The microflow activity `Embeddings (advanced)` can be used in cases where the above-mentioned microflows do not provide enough support or flexibility. The interface of this operation resembles the API interface. Two accompanying microflows are available to help construct the input for the main microflow: 

* `EmbeddingsRequest_Create` is used to create the request object.
* `EmbeddingsInput_Create` is used to create the input object.

The construction of the request and handling of the response must be implemented in a custom way.

For technical details, see the [Technical reference](#embeddings-advanced-technical) section.

A chat completions request that creates a model response for the given chat conversation. 

| Attribute           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Model`             | This is required for requests to OpenAI. Model is NOT considered for request to Azure OpenAI, because the model is determined by the deployment.<br />For more information, see the [compatible models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) in the OpenAI documentation. |
| `Frequency_penalty` | The value should be a decimal between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood of repeating the same line verbatim. This attribute is optional. The default value is 0.0. |
| `Max_tokens`        | This is the maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. This attribute is optional. |
| `Temperature`       | This is the sampling temperature. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. This attribute is optional. The value should be a decimal between 0.0 and 2.0. The default value is 1.0. |
| `Top_p`             | This is an alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with `Top_p` probability mass. 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. Mendix generally recommends altering `Top_p` or `Temperature` but not both. This attribute is optional. The value should be a decimal between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is 1.0. |
| `N`                 | This is the number of chat completions choices to generate for each input message. You will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all choices. Keep `N` as 1 to minimize costs. This attribute is optional. The default value is 1. |

{{% alert color="info" %}}The request and response parts of the domain model were designed to portray the [API reference of OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) as close as possible.{{% /alert %}}

### 4.3 Activities {#activities} 

Activities define the actions that are executed in a microflow or a nanoflow.

#### 4.3.1 Chat Completions {#chatcompletions-technical}

The chat completions API from OpenAI accepts a complex JSON structure that consists of a number of parameters plus one or more messages as input and generates a model-generated message structure as output. While the chat structure is designed for facilitating multi-turn conversations (with history), it is equally valuable for single-turn tasks that do not involve any prior conversation (without history). The exposed microflows in this connector are built to abstract away the complex message structure and are meant to facilitate easier implementation in certain use cases. 

##### 4.3.1.1 Chat Completions (Without History) {#chat-completions-without-history-technical} 

Use the microflow `ChatCompletions_Execute_WithoutHistory` to execute a simple chat completions API call with string input and output not considering a previous conversation. See [ENUM_Role](#enum-role) for the difference between `UserPrompt` and `SystemPrompt`. It is not required to provide a `SystemPrompt` string. The `Model` value is mandatory for OpenAI, but is ignored for Azure OpenAI type configurations where it is implicitly specified by the deployment already.
For [specific models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/json-mode) it is possible to force the assistant response to be a valid JSON structure using the optional `ENUM_ResponseFormat_Chat` [parameter](#enum-responseformat-chat); if no value is specified, the default value as specified in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) will be assumed by the API.

##### 4.3.1.3 Chat Completions (Advanced) {#chat-completions-advanced-technical}

For developers who want to configure the [ChatCompletionsRequest](#chatcompletionsrequest) object themselves and adjust its attributes according to their needs, Mendix recommends using the `ChatCompletions_CallAPI` microflow. The inputs and output are shown in the table below: 

**Input parameters**

| Name                     | Type                                              | Mandatory | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ChatCompletionsRequest` | [ChatCompletionsRequest](#chatcompletionsrequest) | mandatory | This is the request object with associated messages as specified by the Chat Completions API. |
| `Configuration`          | [Configuration](#configuration-entity)            | mandatory | This is the an object that contains endpoint and API key.    |

**Return value**

| Name                      | Type                                                | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ChatCompletionsResponse` | [ChatCompletionsResponse](#chatcompletionsresponse) | This is the response object containing the assistant message and other details about the request. |

This option can be used if the default values of the `ChatCompletionsRequest` are insufficient and must be changed to work for your specific use case. It is also useful if you are interested in other [ChatCompletionsResponse](#chatcompletionsresponse) values apart from the assistant response like usage metrics or multiple choices. 
The following flows may be used in order to construct and handle the required inputs: `ChatCompletionsRequest_Create`,  `ChatCompletionsMessages_Create` and `ChatCompletionsMessageRequest_Create`. 

#### 4.3.2 Image Generations {#image-generations-technical} 

The image generations API from OpenAI accepts a JSON structure that consists of a number of parameters including the user prompt as input and generates a structure of one or many model-generated images as output. The image is returned as a URL or as a base64 string. Depending on the model used, the API can return one or many model-generated images based on the input prompt plus other optional parameters. The exposed microflows in this connector are built to abstract away part of the complexity of the input and output structures and are meant to facilitate easier implementation in certain use cases. Currently, only the OpenAI API provides support for images (not Azure OpenAI).

##### 4.3.2.1 Image Generations (Single Image) {#image-generations-single-technical} 

Use the microflow `ImageGenerations_Execute` to execute a single image generations API call based on a prompt string input, where the response is mapped as an image onto the `OutputImage` object. The `OutputImage` instance must be a specialization of `GeneratedImage`. It is not required to provide the `Model`, `ENUM_Size`, `UserString`, `ENUM_Quality`, `ENUM_Style` and `ENUM_ResponseFormat_Image`  values. For the optional parameters, if left empty, the default value as specified by the OpenAI documentation will be assumed in the API.

**Input parameters**

| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `IsSuccess` | Boolean | The value is `true` if the image generations request was successful. The value is `false` if an error occurred or a validation failed. |

##### 4.3.2.2 Image Generations (advanced) {#image-generations-advanced-technical} 

For developers who want to configure the [ImageGenerationsRequest](#chatcompletionsrequest) object themselves and adjust its attributes according to their needs, Mendix recommends using the `ImageGenerations_CallAPI` microflow. The inputs and output are shown in the table below: 

**Input parameters**

| Name                      | Type                                               | Mandatory | Description                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ImageGenerationsRequest` | [ImageGenerationsRequest](#chatcompletionsrequest) | mandatory | This is the request object for the Image Generations API. |
| `Configuration`           | [Configuration](#configuration-entity)             | mandatory | This is an object that contains endpoint and API key.     |

**Return value**

| Name                       | Type                                                  | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ImageGenerationsResponse` | [ImageGenerationsResponse](#imagegenerationsresponse) | This is the response object containing the generated image. |

The microflow `ImageGenerationsRequest_Create` may be used here to create and handle the input request in a custom way.

#### 4.3.3 Embeddings

The embeddings API from OpenAI accepts a complex JSON structure that consists of a number of parameters plus one or more text strings as input and generates a structure of model-generated vector embeddings as output; per input string one vector is returned. Depending on the use case, there may be a need of generating an embedding for a single text at a time, whereas in the case of processing larger amount of data, bigger texts or data sets will be split up in discrete chunks, for which embeddings can be generated using batches of multiple input texts. The exposed microflows in this connector are built to abstract away the complex message structure and are meant to facilitate easier implementation in certain use cases. 

##### 4.3.3.1 Embeddings (single input) {#embeddings-single-technical} 

Use the microflow `Embeddings_Execute_SingleInput` to execute a call to the embeddings API for a single string input. The output will be the string representation of a vector embedding for the input. See [ENUM_EncodingFormat_Embeddings](#enum-encodingformat-embeddings) for information of what is suported in terms of vector encoding formats. The encoding format can be left empty: if no value is specified, the default value as specified in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) will be assumed by the API. The `Model` value is mandatory for OpenAI, but is ignored for Azure OpenAI type configurations where it is implicitly specified by the deployment already.

**Input parameters**

| Name             | Type                                                         | Mandatory                     | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Input`          | String                                                       | mandatory                     | This is the input text to embed.                             |
| `Configuration`  | [Configuration](#configuration-entity)                       | mandatory                     | This is an object that contains endpoint and API key.        |
| `Model`          | String                                                       | only mandatory for **OpenAI** | This is the ID of the model to use. This is not considered for **Azure OpenAI** configurations. |
| `EncodingFormat` | [ENUM_EncodingFormat_Embeddings](#enum-encodingformat-embeddings) | optional                      | This can be used to specify the format in which the generated vectors must be returned. |

**Return value**

| Name              | Type   | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `EmbeddingVector` | String | This is the string representation of a vector embedding for the input. |

##### 4.3.3.2 Embeddings (list input) {#embeddings-list-technical}

Use the microflow `Embeddings_Execute_ListInput` to execute an embeddings API call with a [DataBatch](#databatch) input with a list of text strings, attached to the batch in the form of [DataChunk](#datachunk) objects. The resulting embedding vectors returned by the model end up in the `EmbeddingVector` string attribute of the [DataChunks](#datachunk). See [ENUM_EncodingFormat_Embeddings](#enum-encodingformat-embeddings) for the information of what encoding formats are supported. The encoding format can be left empty: if no value is specified, the default value as specified in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) will be assumed by the API. The `Model` value is mandatory for OpenAI, but is ignored for Azure OpenAI type configurations where it is implicitly specified by the deployment already.

**Input parameters**

| Name             | Type                                                         | Mandatory                     | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DataBatch`      | [DataBatch](#databatch)                                      | mandatory                     | This is a wrapper object for a list of `DataChunk` objects with Inputs for which an Embeddings vector should be generated. |
| `Configuration`  | [Configuration](#configuration-entity)                       | mandatory                     | This is an object that contains endpoint and API key.        |
| `Model`          | String                                                       | only mandatory for **OpenAI** | This is the ID of the model to use. This is not considered for **Azure OpenAI** configurations. |
| `EncodingFormat` | [ENUM_EncodingFormat_Embeddings](#enum-encodingformat-embeddings) | optional                      | This can be used to specify the format in which the generated vectors must be returned. |

**Return value**

| Name        | Type    | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Success`   | Boolean | The value is `true` if the embeddings request was successful. The value is `false` if an error occurred or a validation failed. |

The `DataBatch` is a wrapper object for the list of text strings for which the embeddings are generated. You can use `DataBatch_Create` to create a new `Databatch`  and with `DataChunk_Create` new `DataChunk` objects will be added to the wrapper. The order is not relevant technically here; each `DataChunk` will be enriched with the corresponding embedding vector that was returned in the API call: the microflow `Embeddings_Execute_ListInput` already takes care of mapping the result onto the correct `DataChunk` entities and the microflow itself only returns a `Success` Boolean.

##### 4.3.3.3 Embeddings (Advanced) {#embeddings-advanced-technical}

For developers who want to configure the [EmbeddingsRequest](#embeddingsrequest) object themselves and adjust its attributes according to their needs, Mendix recommends using the `Embeddings_CallAPI` microflow. The inputs and output are shown in the table below: 

**Input parameters**

| Name                | Type                                    | Mandatory | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `EmbeddingsRequest` | [EmbeddingsRequest](#embeddingsrequest) | mandatory | This is the request object for the Embeddings API.    |
| `Configuration`     | [Configuration](#configuration-entity)  | mandatory | This is an object that contains endpoint and API key. |

**Return value**

| Name                 | Type                                      | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `EmbeddingsResponse` | [EmbeddingsResponse](#embeddingsresponse) | This is the response object containing the generated embedding vectors. |

This option can be used if the default values and behavior of the `EmbeddingsRequest` are insufficient and must be changed to work for your specific use case. It is also useful if you are interested in other [EmbeddingsResponse](#embeddingsresponse) values apart from the vector embeddings, like usage metrics. 
The following flows may be used in order to construct and handle the required inputs: `EmbeddingsRequest_Create` and `EmbeddingsInput_Create`.

## 6 Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### 6.1 Outdated JDK Version Causing Errors while Calling the Embeddings API {#outdated-jdk-version}

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a framework needed by Mendix Studio Pro to deploy and run applications. For more infomation, see [Studio Pro System Requirements](/refguide/system-requirements/). Usually, the right JDK version is installed during the installation of Studio Pro, but in some cases it still may be outdated causing exceptions when calling the Embeddings API or other REST-based services with large data volumes.

We have seen the following two exceptions when using JDK version `jdk-11.0.3.7-hotspot`:
`java.net.SocketException - Connection reset` or
`javax.net.ssl.SSLException - Received fatal alert: record_overflow`.

Follow these steps to check your JDK version and update if neccessary:

1. Check your JDK version: In Studio Pro Go to **Edit** -> **Preferences** -> **Deployment**-> **JDK directory**. If the path points to `jdk-11.0.3.7-hotspot`, you need to update the JDK by following the next steps.
2. Go to [Eclipse Temurin JDK 11](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?variant=openjdk11&os=windows&package=jdk) and download the `.msi` file of the latest release of **JDK 11**.
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation steps. Remember the installation path. Usually this should be somethink like `C:/Program Files/Eclipse Adoptium/jdk-11.0.22.7-hotspot`.
4. After the installation has finished, you might be asked to restart your computer.
5. Open Studio Pro and go to **Edit** -> **Preferences** -> **Deployment** -> **JDK directory**. Click on **Browse** and select the folder with the new JDK version you just installed. This should be the folder containing the *bin* folder. Save your settings by clicking **OK**.
6. Run the project and execute the action that threw the above mentioned execption earlier.
    1. You might get an error saying `FAILURE: Build failed with an exception. The supplied javaHome seems to be invalid. I cannot find the java executable.`. Verify that you have selected the right JDK directory containing the updated JDK version. You may also need to updated Gradle. For this, go to **Edit** -> **Preferences** -> **Deployment** -> **Gradle directory**. Click **Browse** and select a newer gradle version from the Mendix folder. In this case we replaced `grade-7.6` with `gradle-7.6.3`. Save your settings by clicking **OK**.
    2. Rerun the project.
